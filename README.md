# NYIKA CLINIC MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

. Being the only Health Care Centre located in Bikita Rural Area, it serves more than 500 patients everyday and currently has 125 workers with the inclusion of the 9 doctors. The Clinic’s basic aim is to provide the best medical services to the people. Due to financial constraints and access to new technology, everyday information in the clinic is recorded manually into traditional flat files and this has led to a series of undesirable problems in the running of the clinic for example, misplacement of files which contain crucial patient details.

 Nyika Clinic’s Management Board has decided to try and eradicate these problems and use a database to store all their records which will fall in line with its vision and main objectives.

### How to use and run the application

After clicking on the website link, it should take you to the login page. Then from the login page you can login to the system if you are a registered user and you login with the correct username and password. Since this is a clinic management system where the system was recommended by the BOD to computerise the system, the system is mainly made for the admin. 

After login you are taken to the admin dashboard. In the admin dashboard, there are icons on the left. you can click on those icons to view the patients table indicating all the patients that have visited the hospital. The drugs table showing all the drugs in the hospital. There is no need to increment the number of drugs available since drugs do not come in ones and when a whole package comes, the user just edits and adds that number to the existing numbers.

The same goes for the employees as well where the user can add, delete, update or view an employee. That is how the clinic managment system designed for the admin works.
