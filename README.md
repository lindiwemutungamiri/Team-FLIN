# NYIKA CLINIC MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

. Being the only Health Care Centre located in Bikita Rural Area, it serves more than 500 patients everyday and currently has 125 workers with the inclusion of the 9 doctors. The Clinic’s basic aim is to provide the best medical services to the people. Due to financial constraints and access to new technology, everyday information in the clinic is recorded manually into traditional flat files and this has led to a series of undesirable problems in the running of the clinic for example, misplacement of files which contain crucial patient details.

 Nyika Clinic’s Management Board has decided to try and eradicate these problems and use a database to store all their records which will fall in line with its vision and main objectives.
